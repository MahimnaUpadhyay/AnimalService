# Animal Service

Hello there, just a brief intro about this project. So, I have developed a basic Animal Service website with the help of **ReactJS**.  I have mainly focused on the Frontend part of this project because I am still learning ReactJS.The Website is not fully responsive, In future I will commit changes but for now I am happy with how it turned out to be. 

Languages I used during the Developing phase were:-
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS

Tools I used during the design phase were:-
- Figma
- Behance (for inspiration)
- Google Fonts
- Unsplash (for images)
