                      Despite the cat’s popularity as a companion animal, <br/>
                      little is known about its bond and relationship with owners. <br></br>
                      The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the different<br></br> 
                      types of relationship that cats might establish with their owners,<br></br>
                      using human attachment and social support theories as a framework for<br></br> 
                      the underpinning bond. A questionnaire was developed to gather<br></br> 
                      information regarding different emotional elements that could underpin<br></br> 
                      the relationship; the cat’s potential perception of the owner as a<br></br> 
                      secure base; the owner’s level of engagement with the cat, their<br></br> 
                      sensitivity to the cat’s needs and the consistency of their interactions<br></br> 
                      with the cat. Five distinct forms of cat–owner relationship were identified.<br></br> 
                      These seemed to constitute what we describe as an:<br></br> 
                      “open relationship”, “remote association”, “casual relationship”,<br></br> 
                      “co-dependence” and “friendship”. The extent to which these relationships<br></br> 
                      involved a bond towards the owner as a source of social support or<br></br> 
                      secure attachment varied. Accordingly, we conclude that the cat–owner bond<br></br>
